### Build Notes
Defining the changes in each build. *Note that if a number is missing, that build failed the deployment process.*

#### b122
*June 20, 2019*

* Latest Oboo software, version `0.0.8-4` - added on-screen notification when updating

* Fresh build

#### b121
*June 19, 2019*

* Updated rc.local to fix issue where /etc/config.json was missing on first boot
* Fix for building new firmware
    * Using avrdude v6.1 so MCU can be flashed
    * Not overwriting libwebsockets with outdated version
* Not including bluetooth kernel module

#### b120
*June 19, 2019*
**Do not use: cannot flash MCU**

* Running latest Oboo software, version `0.0.8-3`, mostly stable
* Created a patch for FBTFT ILI9341 color fix

#### b119
*Oct 8, 2018* 

* Updated Oboo Clock base scripts, specifically the USB update script
	* Upgrade script will only go through after checking a `upgrade.log` file on the USB drive
	* The upgrade will happen if the device's MAC Address is not in the log file
	* Will write MAC address in log file after upgrade
	* This was done to avoid unnecessary updates to already updated devices during manufacturing

#### b118
*Sept 27, 2018*

* NTP - rc.local will now restart this service
* Cards
	* No longer supporting 3-button press for 10 seconds to trigger a firmware update from USB
	* Implemented process launching and management system
	* Implemented playing audio from filesystem
	* Reading status data from Bluetooth module, using it to intelligently switch between BT and Omega audio
	* Timer now plays a sound when it expires

#### b117
*Sept 25, 2018*

* Card Manager: 
	* Notifications - implemented setting and clearing with mqtt messages
* Cards & Runtime:
	* Added System Card that appears only when user does a simultaneous triple-button press, and disappears when a gesture is detected
	* System card allows users to use the buttons to do specific things on the Oboo - enter setup mode, enter bt pariring mode, etc
* Hotplug
	* **Changed method to flash new firmware**: now whenever a USB drive is inserted with a file called `oboo.bin`, it will attempt to upgrade to that firmware
	* Added wifi hotplug script to populate the wifi icon in the status bar
* NTP - uci-defaults now enable this service

#### b116
*Sept 17, 2018*

* Touch bar: Enabled multi-touch and press duration tracking
* Added a method to flash new firmware from USB drive by pressing all buttons 1,2,3 (the three on the right) at the same time for 10 seconds or more and then releasing

#### b115
*Sept 17, 2018*

* Fixed issue in production firmware where display does not start
	* Root cause: Card Manager could not start because the Mosquitto broker never initializes
		* Mosquitto broker never initializes due to missing mosquitto user
	* Resolution: no longer overwriting shadow file (which resulted in deletion of the mosquitto user), now just inserting the production model password instead
* Updated Cards and Display manager to resolve card crashing and piling up on display issue


#### b114
*Sept 11, 2018*

Default firmware for initial production run

* Updated MCU firmware to reduce all button sensitivity - phantom button presses resolved
* Fixed cron system - now running properly 
* Updated cgi bin provisioning scripts - can now configure Oboo Clock with app properly
	* For now, setup mode is always enabled at boot. Will remove this once System card is available
* Added info display dimming controls with Onion script
* Added a device landing page (if anybody points their browser to the Oboo)

#### b113
*Sept 6, 2018*

* Updated MCU firmware to reduce sensitivity on buttons 2 and 3 - attempting to get rid of phantom button presses
* Added Oboo Smart Clock production model as a target
	* A new password is set for this model
	* SSH access is disabled for this model
* Serial access now requires a password
* CGI bin provisioning scripts updated
	* All now require a flag (existence of a specific file) to operate
	* Added script to change root password

#### b112
